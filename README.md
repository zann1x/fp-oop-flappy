# Flappy Bird - Functional and Object oriented

This project was a course work at university about the subject "New Technologies in Computer Science". The topic I was working was called "Functional Programming Techniques in Object Oriented Languages". As language of choice I selected C++.

The project is a basic Flappy Bird clone (without collision detection or anything). It simply shows how a functional approach can be taken for implementing a game.

The define "_RUN_FUNCTIONAL" in the premake5.lua file determines whether to execute the game (at least partially) in a functional manner or not.
